- [RippedGuide](https://ripped.guide/)
- [r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index) - more than just piracy, but is too large so would caution going through it
- [AwesomePiracy - GitHub](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) - slightly outdated but has great stuff
- // [WebOasis](https://weboasis.app/)

# Media:
## Movies/TV:
- [HDSeries.cc](https://www3.hdseries.cc/)
- [HiMovies](https://www5.himovies.to/)
- [FMovies](https://fmovies.to/)
- (DL) [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/)

## Anime:
- [9Anime](https://9anime.me/) -  Has everything in good quality (mp4upload server is the best quality, then VideoVard - speed is region dependant, try all)
- [Zoro](https://zoro.to/) - Same quality as 9Anime, but has a different UI and player.
- [Tenshi](https://tenshi.moe/) - Best quality in streaming, limited options
- [AniMixPlay](https://animixplay.to/) - (Mirrors GOGO)Mixed bag in quality, can be better than 9Anime or worse depending on the airing date - Great speeds.
- (DL) [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/) - Has everything
- (DL) [AniDex](https://anidex.info/) - similar to nyaa, but nyaa is more popular. Use if ISP blocks nyaa, and you can't/don't want to use GoodbyeDPI.

## Manga:
- [Mangasee](https://mangasee123.com/) - Best quality, is a bit slow, and doesn't have everything. (Is slow in tachiyomi, I recommend using webview in tachi to read)
- // [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) - It's the OG. I don't personally like it, but give it a try.
- [Manganato](https://manganato.com/) - Aggregator - Has everything, but mixed quality - Great speeds on tachiyomi
- [MangaBuddy](https://mangabuddy.com/) - Similar to Manganato, but has more stuff. Not great quality. Mixed speeds on tachiyomi.
- (18+) [Toonily](https://toonily.com/) - 18+ webtoon site, great quality and speeds, is up to date.

### For Android:
- [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) - the best manga reader for android.
- [Forks of Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/) - I personally HIGHLY recommend using tachiyomiSY. It has many more features (even past hentai). Disable Integrated Hentai features in advanced if you don't want it. (I don't use it, I prefer Toonily)
  - **Recommended Settings:**
    - Library > Items per row > 3 in portrait
    - Reader > Download Threads (experiment with this) > 4
    - Reader > Reader cache size > 1GB
    - Reader > Aggresively load pages > on
    - Reader > Page preload amount > 12
    - Highly recommend using categories in libraries to organise your manga.
    - Go through all the customisation options, if you want to. 
    - Use all the extensions from the websites mentioned above.
- [Kotatsu](https://github.com/nv95/Kotatsu) - manga reader. not as functional as tachiyomi.
- [Saikou](https://github.com/saikou-app/saikou) - Personally use it only for anime occasionally. Manga features are clunky, but has great potential.
