# Wiki/Indexes:
A lot of inspiration was drawn from here, so check them out:
### Piracy:
- [r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index) - very well updated, and has more than just piracy, but can be daunting for new users due to its size. (more useful for streaming sites, and miscellaneous non-piracy tools)
- [r/Piracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread) - good balance of enough items, and decently updated - use more for software sites, etc.
- [r/animepiracy wiki](https://theindex.moe/) - General wiki/megathread for all things weeb. Refer to my section on anime and manga for a quality curated section.
- [RippedGuide](https://ripped.guide/)
- [AwesomePiracy - GitHub](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) - slightly outdated but has great stuff
- // [WebOasis](https://weboasis.app/)

# Media:
## Movies/TV:
- [r/FMHY Streaming Section](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/video) - well updated index of streaming sites, but is a bit too large, so I have listed some of my favourites.
- [HDSeries.cc](https://www3.hdseries.cc/) - mirror of HiMovies, but I like that it doesn't have multiquality playback, so I don't have to choose everytime (and its faster in general)
- [theflix](https://theflix.to) - Great quality, limited selection. Is weird to get working, sometimes clicking on a series can show a "404 Not Found" page, but changing the season and episode in the url can get it to work.
- [FMovies](https://fmovies.to/) - The OG. Not the best quality, but just has a lot. Often blocked by ISP. Refer the Unblocking Guide.
- [PrimeWire](https://primewire.tf) or [HydraWire](https://hydrawire.tv) - alternate UI, and is a bit daunting for new users.
- (DL - Torrent) [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/) - download (torrent) any TV or Movie you want. Tip: Sort by seeders descending.

## Anime:
- [Tenshi](https://tenshi.moe/) - Best quality in streaming, limited options
- [9Anime](https://9anime.me/) -  Has everything in good quality (mp4upload server is the best quality, then VideoVard - speed is region dependant, try all)
- [Zoro](https://zoro.to/) - Same quality as 9Anime, but has a different UI and player.
- [AniMixPlay](https://animixplay.to/) - (Mirrors GOGO)Mixed bag in quality, can be better than 9Anime or worse depending on the airing date - Great speeds.
- (DL) [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/) - Has everything
- (DL) [AniDex](https://anidex.info/) - similar to nyaa, but nyaa is more popular. Use if ISP blocks nyaa, and you can't/don't want to use GoodbyeDPI.

## Manga:
- [Mangasee](https://mangasee123.com/) - Best quality, is a bit slow, and doesn't have everything. (Is slow in tachiyomi, I recommend using webview in tachi to read)
- // [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) - It's the OG. I don't personally like it, but give it a try.
- [Manganato](https://manganato.com/) - Aggregator - Has everything, but mixed quality - Great speeds on tachiyomi
- [MangaBuddy](https://mangabuddy.com/) - Similar to Manganato, but has more stuff. Not great quality. Mixed speeds on tachiyomi.
- (18+) [Toonily](https://toonily.com/) - 18+ webtoon site, great quality and speeds, is up to date.

### For Android:
- [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) - the best manga reader for android.
- [Forks of Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/) - I personally HIGHLY recommend using tachiyomiSY. It has many more features (even past hentai). Disable Integrated Hentai features in advanced if you don't want it. (I don't use it, I prefer Toonily)
  - **Recommended Settings:**
    - Library > Items per row > 3 in portrait
    - Reader > Download Threads (experiment with this) > 4
    - Reader > Reader cache size > 1GB
    - Reader > Aggresively load pages > on
    - Reader > Page preload amount > 12
    - Highly recommend using categories in libraries to organise your manga.
    - Go through all the customisation options, if you want to. 
    - Use all the extensions from the websites mentioned above.
- [Kotatsu](https://github.com/nv95/Kotatsu) - manga reader. not as functional as tachiyomi.
- [Saikou](https://github.com/saikou-app/saikou) - Personally use it only for anime occasionally. Manga features are clunky, but has great potential.

# Tools:
## Login Details:
For maintaining anonymity:
- [mail.tm](https://mail.tm/en/) - Not quite temporary email, but throwaway. Use if you need an email for an account for which you still want recovery options, but don't want to link to yourself. Don't trust this email service too much though. Also **_keep track of the email domain_**, and save it. It changes frequently.
- [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/) - Mail forwarding platform. Open Source. Provides some privacy for signups, and is quite useful, can be an alternative to mail.tm.
- [FirefoxRelay](https://relay.firefox.com/) - Mail forwarding platform similar to AnonAddy. I prefer AnonAddy, but check this out too.
- [sms24](https://sms24.me/en/) - for throwaway registrations. Don't expect anything more than that. Use only for non-critical accounts which don't need any recovery options and if you don't mind the risk of using a publicly accessible number.
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) - Well rated email provider for secure email.
