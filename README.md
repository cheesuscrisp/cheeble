- [RippedGuide](https://ripped.guide/)
- [r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index) - more than just piracy, but is too large so would caution going through it
- [AwesomePiracy - GitHub](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) - slightly outdated but has great stuff
- // [WebOasis](https://weboasis.app/)

# Media:
## Movies/TV:
- [HDSeries.cc](https://www3.hdseries.cc/)
- [HiMovies](https://www5.himovies.to/)
- [FMovies](https://fmovies.to/)
- (DL) [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/)

## Anime:
- [9Anime](https://9anime.me/) -  Has everything in good quality (mp4upload server is the best quality, then VideoVard - speed is region dependant, try all)
- [Zoro](https://zoro.to/) - Same quality as 9Anime, but has a different UI and player.
- [Tenshi](https://tenshi.moe/) - Best quality in streaming, limited options
- [AniMixPlay](https://animixplay.to/) - (Mirrors GOGO)Mixed bag in quality, can be better than 9Anime or worse depending on the airing date - Great speeds.
- (DL) [Nyaa](https://nyaa.si/) - Has everything
- (DL) [AniDex](https://anidex.info/) - similar to nyaa, but nyaa is more popular. Use if ISP blocks nyaa, and you can't/don't want to use GoodbyeDPI.

## Manga:
- [Mangasee](https://mangasee123.com/) - Best quality, is a bit slow, and doesn't have everything. (Is slow in tachiyomi, I recommend using webview in tachi to read)
- // [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/) - It's the OG. I don't personally like it, but give it a try.
- [Manganato](https://manganato.com/) - Aggregator - Has everything, but mixed quality - Great speeds on tachiyomi
- [MangaBuddy](https://mangabuddy.com/) - Similar to Manganato, but has more stuff. Not great quality. Mixed speeds on tachiyomi.
- (18+) [Toonily](https://toonily.com/) - 18+ webtoon site, great quality and speeds, is up to date.

### For Android:
- [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/) - the best manga reader for android.
- [Forks of Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/) - I personally HIGHLY recommend using tachiyomiSY. It has many more features (even past hentai). Disable Integrated Hentai features in advanced if you don't want it. (I don't use it, I prefer Toonily)
  - **Recommended Settings:**
    - Library > Items per row > 3 in portrait
    - Reader > Download Threads (experiment with this) > 4
    - Reader > Reader cache size > 1GB
    - Reader > Aggresively load pages > on
    - Reader > Page preload amount > 12
    - Highly recommend using categories in libraries to organise your manga.
    - Go through all the customisation options, if you want to. 
    - Use all the extensions from the websites mentioned above.
- [Kotatsu](https://github.com/nv95/Kotatsu) - manga reader. not as functional as tachiyomi.
- [Saikou](https://github.com/saikou-app/saikou) - Personally use it only for anime occasionally. Manga features are clunky, but has great potential.

# Tools:
## Login Details:
For maintaining anonymity:
- [mail.tm](https://mail.tm/en/) - Not quite temporary email, but throwaway. Use if you need an email for an account for which you still want recovery options, but don't want to link to yourself. Don't trust this email service too much though. Also **_keep track of the email domain_**, and save it. It changes frequently.
- [AnonAddy](https://anonaddy.com/) - Mail forwarding platform. Open Source. Provides some privacy for signups, and is quite useful, can be an alternative to mail.tm.
- [FirefoxRelay](https://relay.firefox.com/) - Mail forwarding platform similar to AnonAddy. I prefer AnonAddy, but check this out too.
- [sms24](https://sms24.me/en/) - for throwaway registrations. Don't expect anything more than that. Use only for non-critical accounts which don't need any recovery options and if you don't mind the risk of using a publicly accessible number.
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) - Well rated email provider for secure email.
